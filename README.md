# Elementary Affine Calculus (EAC)

The Elementary Affine Calculus (EAC) is a very simple, untyped language similar to the Î»-calculus, but with two notable differences:

1. It is terminating.

2. It is fully compatible with the [optimal reduction algorithm](https://medium.com/@maiavictor/solving-the-mystery-behind-abstract-algorithms-magical-optimizations-144225164b07).

This allows the EAC to be evaluated optimally in massively parallel architectures, making it a great intermediate compile target for functional languages. It isn't Turing-complete, but is expressive enough to encode arbitrary algebraic datatypes (ex: booleans, natural numbers, lists), pattern-matching (ex: if-then-else, switch statements) and Church-encoded iteration (ex: bounded for-loops and recursion).

## Usage

Right now, this repository includes a small, dependency-free JS implementation, including parser, interpreter and optimal (NASIC) reducer. Using it from the terminal is simple:

```
npm i -g elementary-affine-calculus
eac term_name # in a directory with .eac files
```

You can also import it and use as a library.

## Syntax

```
var ::=
  <any alphanumeric string>

term ::=
  var             -- variables
  [var] term      -- lambdas
  (term term)     -- applicatons
  | term          -- box 
  [x = term] term -- duplication
```

## Examples

Examples can be seen on the [main.eac](main.eac) file.

## Relationship to SIC, Formality, etc.

[Symmetric Interaction Combinators](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1731/a6e49c6c2afda3e72256ba0afb34957377d3.pdf) are an universal interaction net system. They are the foundation for my optimal reducer implementations.

[N-Ary Symmetric Interaction Combinators](https://github.com/moonad/nasic) (NASIC) are similar to Symmetric Interaction Combinators, except with 32-bit integers instead of boolean labels on nodes, for practical optimization purposes, allowing EAC terms to be compiled to single nodes. NASIC is like the "assembly language" of EAC and Formality, it is the system that can be implemented on GPUs, for example.

The [Symmetric Interaction Calculus](https://github.com/maiavictor/symmetric-interaction-calculus) is a textual syntax for Symmetric Interaction Combinators. As such, it is Turing-complete, and isn't an usual programming language due to global scopes.

[Formality](https://github.com/moonad/formality) is a typed proof language that compiles to untyped EAC terms, which are then compiled to NASIC to run efficiently.

Litereum: the simplest decentralized computer
=============================================

In 2013, the first generalized transaction ledger, Ethereum, was proposed,
extending Bitcoin with a stateful scripting language that allowed arbitrary
transactions to be settled without third parties. Due to continuous protocol
improvements, Ethereum became complex, which led to an unbalance of power
between core developers and normal users. Litereum is a massive simplification
of Ethereum, which trades scalability and cutting-edge features for sheer
simplicity and security. It is designed to be final and never require updates.
As such, users are able to understand and implement the protocol with minimal
effort, making Litereum the most politically neutral decentralized computer.

Design
------

Litereum's design is a combination of 3 components:

1. LitSign: a minimal, hash-based signature scheme that can't be broken by quantum
   computers. It is an adaptation of WOTS signatures.

2. LitCons: a minimal, proof-of-work consensus algorithm for peer-to-peer
   transactions. It is a simplification of Nakamoto Consensus.

3. LitCore: a minimal, statically-typed language that is prone to formal
   verification. It is a stateful calculus based on datatypes and recursion.

Litereum doesn't have a native currency. Instead, it is a truly pure and neutral
decentralized computer.

Roadmap
-------

2021. Publish the white-paper and reference implementations.

That's all: Litereum is final and won't require updates.
